All of our poultry are free to run, scratch and fly. Our truly pastured chickens still have their beaks! Most eggs, even certified organic eggs, come from de-beaked hens. We never de-beak our chickens as they need their beaks to eat the grasses and insects that gives their eggs the rich color, taste and nutrition. Our eggs are NOT the same as store bought eggs. Our eggs are always 100% Soy, GMO, Hormone and Antibiotic-free and come from entirely stress free and truly free roaming birds. 100% Pasture raised and fertile. Dark and creamy yolks.
